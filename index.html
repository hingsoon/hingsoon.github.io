        <h1>Singapore Round Island Route</h1>
        <p>In early 2012, the Singapore government announced that it would be building a 150km long Singapore Round Island Route that would run along the coast connecting parks and places of interest. </p>

        <!--Copy and paste the div below for creating content blocks-->
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>This purpose of this map is to give a best guess effort on recreating the Round Island Route from sources available in the web. By using this map, readers can see what is available currently and plan their exploratory routes accordingly The reason that the mapping was difficult is because only high level (low details) graphical maps were found online. Most of the route in this map is based on a best guess effort from graphic files online, from some park connector layer that was made available by the Singapore NParks and the authors knowledge of the area.</p>

        <!-- <h3>Sources</h3>
        <p>Unexpected discoveries about the <a href="#">Cosmos and our place</a> within it, explorations that are <a href="#">exhilarating</a> to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this.</p>
