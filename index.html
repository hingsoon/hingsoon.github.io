        <h1>Singapore Round Island Route</h1>
        <p>In early 2012, the Singapore government announced that it would be building a 150km long Singapore Round Island Route that would run along the coast connecting parks and places of interest. </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>This purpose of this map is to give a best guess effort on recreating the Round Island Route from sources available in the web. By using this map, readers can see what is available currently and plan their exploratory routes of Singapore accordingly. The reason that the mapping was difficult is because only high level (low details) graphical maps were found online. Most of the route in this map is based on a best guess effort from graphic files online, from some park connector layer that was made available by the Singapore NParks and the author's knowledge of some parts of the area.</p>

        <h3>Sources</h3>
        <p>The Round Island Route is primarily based on a graphical map published by URA <a href="http://www.ura.gov.sg/MS/DMP2013/key-focuses/transport/cycling-for-all.aspx">National Cycling Plan</a>. </p>
		<p>Overlaid in a greyish colour on the map are Singapore's published <a href="http://data.gov.sg/Metadata/OneMapMetadata.aspx?id=Park_Connector_Loops&mid=120414&t=SPATIAL">Park Connector Network</a> made available by NParks. This was an important source for all the guesses.</p>
